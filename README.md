# Time-Series-Forecasting-Household-Electric-Power-Consumption

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to revise my knowledge about Time Series Forecasting.

### Methods Used
* Time Series decomposition
* Machine Learning: XGBoost
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
The task is to forecast 24-hour steps of electric power consumption, hourly. Most of the methods here, I have learned from https://www.wqu.edu/programs/applied-ds-lab/, the course has changed into lab now.
