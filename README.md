# Time-Series-Forecasting-Household-Electric-Power-Consumption
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to revise my knowledge about Time Series Forecasting.

### Methods Used
* Time Series decomposition
* Machine Learning: XGBoost
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
The task is to forecast 24-hour steps of electric power consumption, hourly. Most of the methods here, I have learned from https://www.wqu.edu/programs/applied-ds-lab/, the course has changed into lab now.

## Getting Started
